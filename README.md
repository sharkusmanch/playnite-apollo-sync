## 📦 Installation

### Requirements
- **Playnite** 6.2.0 or higher
- **Apollo** or **Sunshine** streaming application
- **.NET Framework 4.6.2** or higher

### Install from Playnite Add-ons
1. Open Playnite
2. Go to **Add-ons** → **Browse**
3. Search for "ApolloSync"
4. Click **Install**

### Manual Installation
1. Download the latest `.pext` file from [Releases](https://github.com/your-username/ApolloSync/releases)
2. In Playnite, go to **Add-ons** → **Install Add-on**
3. Select the downloaded `.pext` file
4. Restart Playnite

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Initial Setup
1. Go to **Extensions** → **ApolloSync** → **Settings**
2. Set the path to your Apollo/Sunshine `apps.json` file
3. Configure automatic sync options as desired
4. Choose one or more Playnite filter presets to define which games are exported (the extension leverages your existing filters)

### Settings Overview

#### General Tab
- **Auto-export installed games** - Automatically export games when they're installed
- **Auto-remove uninstalled games** - Automatically remove games when they're uninstalled
- **Sync all on library update** - Export all installed games after library updates
- **Apps.json path** - Path to your Apollo/Sunshine configuration file

#### Filters Tab
- **Use Playnite Filter Presets** - Select saved presets; a game is exported if it matches any selected preset (OR logic)
- **Platform selection** - Choose which gaming platforms to include
- **Label requirements** - Require specific labels for export
- **Completion status** - Filter by game completion status
- **Bulk selection tools** - Select All/Clear All buttons for easy management

### 🔐 Permissions for apps.json
If your `apps.json` lives under `C:\Program Files\...`, Windows may block write access for standard users.

- What the extension does:
    - On save, it retries briefly on transient IO errors.
    - If access is denied, it will prompt you to elevate and will attempt to grant Modify permission to the Users group for that file, then retry the save.

- Manual options if you prefer not to elevate in-app:
    - Point the extension to a user-writable path for `apps.json`.
    - Run Playnite as Administrator (not generally recommended).
    - Adjust permissions yourself via File Properties → Security (grant Modify to Users) or an equivalent admin command.
    - After changing permissions, re-run the sync.

## 🎮 Usage

### How exports are selected
- ApolloSync leverages your existing Playnite filter presets to decide which games are exported.
- If you select multiple presets, a game is exported when it matches any of them (OR logic).
- Pinned games won’t be auto-removed even if they stop matching your presets.

### Automatic Operations
Once configured, ApolloSync works automatically:
- Installing a game in Playnite → Automatically appears in Apollo/Sunshine
- Uninstalling a game → Automatically removed from Apollo/Sunshine
- Library updates → All installed games are synchronized

### Manual Operations

#### Game Context Menu
Right-click any game in Playnite to access:
- **Export to Apollo/Sunshine** - Manually export selected games
- **Remove from Apollo/Sunshine** - Manually remove selected games
- **Sync all installed games** - Sync entire library

#### Main Menu
Access **Extensions** → **ApolloSync** for:
- **Sync all installed games** - Bulk synchronization
- **Manage Exported Games** - View and manage exported games

#### Managed Games Window
- View all games currently exported to Apollo/Sunshine
- Remove games individually or in bulk
- See export status and metadata
- Filter and search exported games
